Decision Trees
========================================================

We will have a look at the `Carseats` data using the `tree` package in R, as in the lab in the book.
We create a binary response variable `High` (for high sales), and we include it in the same dataframe.
```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(tree)
attach(Carseats)
hist(Sales)
High=ifelse(Sales<=8,"No","Yes")
Carseats=data.frame(Carseats, High)
```

Now we fit a tree to these data, and summarize and plot it. Notice that we have to _exclude_ `Sales` from the right-hand side of the formula, because the response is derived from it.
```{r}
tree.carseats=tree(High~.-Sales,data=Carseats)
summary(tree.carseats)
plot(tree.carseats)
text(tree.carseats,pretty=0)
```
For a detailed summary of the tree, print it:
```{r}
tree.carseats
```
Lets create a training and test set (250,150) split of the 400 observations, grow the tree on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set.
```{r}
set.seed(1011)
train=sample(1:nrow(Carseats),250)
tree.carseats=tree(High~.-Sales,Carseats,subset=train)
plot(tree.carseats);text(tree.carseats,pretty=0)
tree.pred=predict(tree.carseats,Carseats[-train,],type="class")
with(Carseats[-train,],table(tree.pred,High))
(72+33)/150
```
This tree was grown to full depth, and might be too variable. We now use CV to prune it.
```{r}
cv.carseats=cv.tree(tree.carseats,FUN=prune.misclass)
cv.carseats
plot(cv.carseats)
prune.carseats=prune.misclass(tree.carseats,best=13)
plot(prune.carseats);text(prune.carseats,pretty=0)
```
Now lets evaluate this pruned tree on the test data.
```{r}
tree.pred=predict(prune.carseats,Carseats[-train,],type="class")
with(Carseats[-train,],table(tree.pred,High))
(72+32)/150
```
It has done about the same as our original tree. So pruning did not hurt us wrt misclassification errors, and gave us a simpler tree.
